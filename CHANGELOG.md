## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support for `ansible_host_var` resource type
- Support for `ansible_group_var` resource type

### Fixed
- Corrected a minor issue where `ansible_host` or `ansible_host_var` resources with the same `inventory_hostname` would result in multiple copies of the hostname in any groups they shared in common (including the "all" group)

## [2.0.0] - 2019-05-05
### Added
- Support for Terraform 0.12's new state file structure
- Simple regression testing with Bash scripts

### Changed
- Removed version-specific python shebang, as `terraform.py` seems to work fine with Python 2.7 and 3.x

### Removed
- `terraform state pull` no longer uses `-input=false` as this argument is not recognized by Terraform 0.12

## [1.1.0] - 2019-01-09
### Added
- Support for Terraform workspaces via `ANSIBLE_TF_WS_NAME` environment variable. Thanks [@dnitsch]!

### Added
- Support for `ansible_group` resource, added in [nbering/terraform-provider-ansible#8](https://github.com/nbering/terraform-provider-ansible/pull/8)

## [1.0.0] - 2018-01-07
### Added
- Added `ANSIBLE_TF_DIR` environment variable to set Terraform configuration directory.

### Changed
- Ported the script to Python to be more compatible with the Ansible ecosystem.
- Changed `TERRAFORM_PATH` environment variable to `ANSIBLE_TF_PATH`.

### Deprecated
- The earlier NodeJS implementation will not be supported going forward.

## [0.0.2] - 2018-01-06
